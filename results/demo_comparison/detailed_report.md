# Spider Solitaire RL Algorithm Comparison Report

Generated on: 2025-08-28 11:11:54

## Executive Summary

This report compares three reinforcement learning algorithms for playing Spider Solitaire:
- **DQN (Deep Q-Learning)**: Value-based method with experience replay
- **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**: Policy gradient method with value baseline
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Advanced policy gradient with clipping

## Performance Summary

| Algorithm | Avg Reward | Win Rate | Training Time | Stability (σ) |
|-----------|------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| DQN | -91.8 | 0.0% | 120s | 19.6 |
| A2C | -59.8 | 0.0% | 80s | 32.3 |
| PPO | -51.1 | 0.0% | 100s | 15.6 |

## Detailed Analysis

### DQN (Deep Q-Learning)
- **Strengths**: High sample efficiency, can learn from replayed experiences
- **Weaknesses**: Can overestimate Q-values, requires large memory for replay buffer
- **Best for**: Environments where data collection is expensive
- **Key hyperparameters**: Learning rate, epsilon decay, replay buffer size

### A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)
- **Strengths**: Simple implementation, direct policy optimization
- **Weaknesses**: High variance, lower sample efficiency
- **Best for**: Environments where parallel collection is easy
- **Key hyperparameters**: Learning rate, n-steps, entropy coefficient

### PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **Strengths**: Very stable training, state-of-the-art performance
- **Weaknesses**: More complex implementation, computationally intensive
- **Best for**: Complex environments requiring stable learning
- **Key hyperparameters**: Clip range, learning rate, GAE lambda

## Implementation Considerations

### Action Space
- Spider Solitaire has a large discrete action space
- Actions: [move_type, from_column, to_column, num_cards]
- Action masking significantly improves training efficiency

### State Representation
- Tableau: 10 columns × 19 max cards
- Additional features: stock count, foundation count
- CNN feature extraction works well for spatial structure

### Reward Design
- Move penalty: -1 (encourages efficiency)
- Invalid move: -10 (strong negative signal)
- Card reveal: +5 (progress indicator)
- Sequence completion: +100 (major milestone)
- Game win: +1000 (ultimate goal)

## Recommendations

1. **For beginners**: Start with A2C for simplicity
2. **For best performance**: Use PPO with proper hyperparameter tuning
3. **For research**: DQN provides good baseline and interpretability
4. **For production**: PPO with distributed training

## Future Improvements
- Implement Double DQN to reduce overestimation
- Add prioritized experience replay for DQN
- Use LSTM for handling partial observability
- Implement Rainbow DQN combining multiple improvements
- Add self-play for curriculum learning
